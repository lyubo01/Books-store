link for the site ---> google-books-store-asessment.netlify.app

This is my project for a book store. I have taken data from the Google books api and implemented in the site. It has a navigarion bar that is sticky(stays while scrolling).
It has a filter input which filters which books show based on their categorie. It has a sort input which can sort the books 4 ways - a-z, z-a, year ascendding and year descending.
it has a show more/show less button which adds the books that aren't seen initially when loading the page and respectively hides the books that weren't initially shown.
There is a 'Show randodm book' methodd in the nav which shows a random book with a little more information regarding the author and description.Initially I wantedd to sort them by value andd display a price,
but google books don't provide the information, so for now I haven't put it. Some things I feel can work better are the correspondance between the sort and the filter method, as it works a little strange.
I feel like I am satisfied with what came out and will definetly be updating the stuff I think can be better. It was built from scratch and no libraries and frameworks were used.
